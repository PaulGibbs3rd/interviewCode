Application that I was a project manager / software engineer on. I handled team documentation including software products management plan, Software Requirement Specifications, Maintenancence_Manual, and QA documentation. 

Implemented 0auth2 workflow for our application registering API key with our custom client allowing for users to add a timer for expiration to tweets.
