            This sample demonstrates how to construct multipatch geometries using the MultipatchBuilderEx class found in the ArcGIS.Core.Geometry namespace. 
            The MultipatchBuilderEx class also allows you to modify properties of a multipatch including the materials and textures.
            This add-in contains a number of buttons which create and modify multipatch features.
