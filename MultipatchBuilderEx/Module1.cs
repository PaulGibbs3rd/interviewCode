  /// 1. Download the Community Sample data (see under the 'Resources' section for downloading sample data)
  /// 1. Make sure that the Sample data is unzipped in C:\Data
  /// 1. Before you run the sample verify that the project "C:\Data\MultipatchTest\MultipatchTest.aprx" is present since this is required to run the sample.
  /// 1. In Visual Studio click the Build menu. Then select Build Solution.
  /// 1. Click Start button to open ArcGIS Pro.
  /// 1. ArcGIS Pro will open.
